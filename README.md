# CSI-370 Computer Architecture Coursework
### Assignment 3
Create a program that calculates the following expression: *answer = (A + B) - (C + D)*
 - 32 bit masm program
 - The answer must be stored in a variable of the correct data type.
 - The values for your data *(A, B, C, D)* must be stored in registers, not variables.
 - You must supply the initial values for the data *(A, B, C, D)*.
 - Create a string that *could* accompany the answer in an output statement
   - (e.g., "The answer is:"). You do not have to output the string.
 - Comment each line of code
### Assignment 4
Write a program that multiplies each element of a WORD array by 8 and stores the new value in the same element of a DWORD array
 - 32 bit masm program
 - The initial array should contain the values 5, 10, 15, 20
 - The result array should contain 40, 80, 120, and 160
